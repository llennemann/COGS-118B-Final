    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of this project is to address the genre categorization problem in the realm of music, utilizing clustering techniques on the Spotify 1.2M+ Songs dataset. With over 100,000 songs released daily, our objective is to categorize songs into distinct genres based on their audio features, hypothesizing that songs within the same genre share similarities in variables like tempo and danceability. The dataset, comprising 24 variables including danceability, tempo, and acousticness, is sourced from the Spotify API. We plan to implement both K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models, comparing their performance using evaluation metrics such as Rand Index and Adjusted Rand Index. Data cleaning involves handling null values, potential one-hot encoding, and standardization. To enhance the user experience on Spotify, personalized recommendations and playlists aligned with individual preferences will be generated based on the identified genres. Success will be measured by the accuracy of the clustering models, evaluated through the Rand Index metrics, providing insights into the effectiveness of our approach in capturing meaningful patterns within the music dataset.\n"

The dataset has over 1.2 million songs and 24 variables. Critical variables include danceability, tempo, acousticness, and energy. The variables danceability, acousticness, and energy have values from 0 to 1, where 0 is not at all. Tempo is measured in beats per minute. For data cleaning, we will need to check that there are no null values. We won’t have to standardize most of the data because most variables are measured on a scale of 0 to 1. "
